# File Handling Rules

## README.md Files
- **Do NOT create or read README.md files** unless explicitly instructed
- **Do NOT suggest creating README files** without user request
- **Do NOT reference README.md** in responses unless specifically asked

## Why These Rules Exist
- Prevents unnecessary token usage
- Avoids creating files the user doesn't need
- Keeps responses focused and efficient
- Reduces network error risks from long responses

## File Operation Guidelines
- **Focus on actual requested tasks**
- **Avoid mentioning README files** unless relevant
- **Keep responses concise** and to the point
- **Use appropriate file patterns** for rule application
- **Maintain clean project structure**

## When to Apply
- Only create README.md when user specifically asks
- Only read existing README.md when user requests it
- Only suggest README.md creation when user asks for documentation help
- Apply to all file operations and chat interactions
