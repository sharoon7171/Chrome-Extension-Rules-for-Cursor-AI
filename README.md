## 🛠️ **How to Use This Project in Your Project**

### **📥 Step 1: Install the Rules**
Use the one-line installation command from the [Install](#-how-to-install) section above:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sharoon7171/Chrome-Extension-Rules-for-Cursor-AI.git && cp -r Chrome-Extension-Rules-for-Cursor-AI/.cursor .cursor && rm -rf Chrome-Extension-Rules-for-Cursor-AI && echo "✅ Installation Complete! Restart Cursor to apply rules."
```

This automatically:
- Downloads the rules
- Copies them to your project's `.cursor/` directory
- Cleans up temporary files
- Installs all 9 rule files automatically

### **🚀 Step 2: Activate Rules in Cursor AI**
1. **Open your project** in Cursor AI
2. **Rules automatically load** when Cursor AI starts
3. **Verify rules are active** - AI should show rule compliance header
4. **Test with a simple command** - Try asking AI to make a code change

### **✅ Step 3: Verify Rules Are Working**
When you ask Cursor AI to make changes, it should:
- **Ask for your approval** before any changes
- **Use terminal for scanning** files first
- **Use Cursor AI editor** for actual changes
- **Show only specific changes** (not rewrite entire files)
- **Follow the 6-step workflow** automatically

### **🔧 Step 4: Use Rules in Daily Development**
- **Ask AI to add features** - It will follow professional standards
- **Request code refactoring** - It will use incremental changes
- **Build Chrome extensions** - It will follow latest compliance rules
- **Create responsive designs** - It will use mobile-first approach

### **📚 Step 5: Customize Rules (Optional)**
You can modify the rules for your specific needs:
- **Edit rule files** in `.cursor/rules/` directory
- **Add project-specific rules** for your team
- **Modify enforcement levels** based on your preferences
- **Create custom workflows** for your development process

#### **Penalty System (ENFORCED)**
- **First Violation**: Warning + immediate workflow restart
- **Second Violation**: 24-hour suspension from all operations
- **Third Violation**: Complete task restart with user supervision
- **Fourth Violation**: User must manually approve all future operations

### **🔧 Development Workflow**
```
User Request → AI Analysis → User Approval → Implementation → Terminal Verification → Completion
```
